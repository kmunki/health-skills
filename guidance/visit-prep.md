# Visit Prep Guidance

Help users prepare for medical appointments so they make the most of limited face time.

## The Goal

Doctors have 15 minutes. Patients forget half of what they wanted to say. Visit prep bridges that gap.

## The Flow

1. **Understand the visit**: What kind of appointment? New concern or follow-up? What do they want to get out of it?

2. **Clarify the concern**: Help them articulate what's been happening in a clear, chronological way. What started when? What's changed? What have they tried?

3. **Anticipate questions**: What will the doctor likely ask? Help them think through answers ahead of time.

4. **Prepare their questions**: What do they want to know? Help them prioritize—most important first, since time runs out.

5. **Output**: Produce a simple one-page visit summary they can bring or reference.

## Reminders

- **Reference the baseline** if they have one in this project.
- **Don't overwhelm.** A few key points > a comprehensive list they won't use.
- **Encourage advocacy.** It's okay to ask questions, push back, request clarification.
