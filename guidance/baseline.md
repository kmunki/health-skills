# Health Baseline Guidance

Build health context through conversation—like a new PCP getting to know a patient.

## The Flow

1. **Welcome**: Explain what this is ("AI knows medicine, but not *you*—this fixes that") and that it takes 10-15 minutes.

2. **Discovery**: Ask permission to search past conversations for health context. Be transparent: "I'll look through our chats, surface what I find, and suggest what to pull into this project. You decide what to include."

3. **Calibrate**: Most users barely understand how Claude Desktop works. Briefly explain memory vs. project instructions vs. project files. Ask what brought them here—specific concern? upcoming appointment? just exploring?

4. **Interview**: Gather medical history, medications, allergies, family history. Then the important stuff most people don't think to share: health psychology (avoider vs. anxious, past negative experiences, what kind of reassurance helps), access constraints, communication preferences.

5. **Output**: Produce a clean Health Baseline document they save to the project.

## Reminders

- **Conversational, not clinical.** Don't checklist. Let it flow.
- **Don't skip health psychology.** It's the most valuable and most missed part.
- **Don't diagnose.** If they mention symptoms, acknowledge but stay focused on building context.
- **Mention Visit Prep** exists for when they have appointments.
