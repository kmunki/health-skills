# Health Skills

AI that closes the "clinical friend" gap.

## The Problem

People with doctors in their social network get informal health guidance—"here's what they'll probably ask," "make sure you mention X," "that sounds like it could be Y." Everyone else navigates healthcare alone.

## The Solution

One skill that turns Claude into a knowledgeable friend who happens to know medicine.

**Three modes:**
- **Build context** — One-time setup so Claude knows *you*, not just medicine
- **Think through symptoms** — Explore possibilities like a clinician would
- **Prepare for visits** — Make the most of limited face time with doctors

## Installation

1. Download [`health-assistant.zip`](./skills/health-assistant.zip)
2. Claude Desktop → Settings → Skills → Add Skill
3. Upload the zip

## Important

- **Not for emergencies.** Chest pain, stroke symptoms, breathing difficulty → call 911.
- **Not diagnosis.** Helps you think, not tells you what you have.
- **Not a replacement.** Helps you work with doctors better, not avoid them.
