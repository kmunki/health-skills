# Claude for Health

AI skills that close the "clinical friend" gap.

## The Problem

People with doctors in their social network get informal health guidance—"here's what they'll probably ask," "make sure you mention X," "that sounds like it could be Y." Everyone else navigates healthcare alone.

AI can fill this gap, but most people aren't using it well. They ask questions in isolation, as if talking to a stranger every time. They don't realize that context changes everything.

## The Insight

AI already knows medicine. What it doesn't know is *you*.

These skills fix that.

## The Skills

### Health Baseline
A one-time interview that builds personal health context—medical history, health psychology, access constraints, communication preferences. Like the getting-to-know-you conversation a good PCP would have with a new patient.

**Why it matters:** Telling AI "I tend to minimize symptoms and delay care" changes how it should respond to you. Context shapes everything.

### Visit Prep (coming soon)
Helps you prepare for medical appointments—clarifying concerns, anticipating questions, preparing to communicate effectively.

## Important Limitations

- **Not for emergencies.** If you're in crisis, call 911 or go to the ER.
- **Doesn't replace doctors.** This helps you work with them better, not avoid them.
- **Not medical advice.** AI can help you think, but decisions are yours.

## Status

Early development. Skills are being drafted and tested.
